# Same Tree
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

## Tags
- Tree

## Strat
If both nodes None, true. If one of them false or diff values, false. Return and of recursive call on both left nodes and both right nodes

## Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n) worst case, O(logn) best case -> depends on recursion stack

## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if p == None and q == None:
            return True
        if q == None or p == None or p.val != q.val:
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
